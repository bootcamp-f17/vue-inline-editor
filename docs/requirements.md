# Inline Editor

Edit text on-the-fly.

## Behavior

1. Display a default message in the browser.
2. When that message is clicked, display an editor.
3. As the text in the editor changes, so should the contents of the message.
4. When the user clicks outside the editor, the editor should disappear.
